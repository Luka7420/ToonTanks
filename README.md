🎮 Toon Tanks – UE5 C++ Project

This is my take on Toon Tanks, a small but fast-paced tank shooter I built in Unreal Engine 5 using C++. It was a great way to get hands-on with gameplay programming while keeping the scope fun and approachable — almost like something you’d see in a game jam.

Here’s what I worked on:

🕹️ Smooth tank movement with WASD and mouse controls

🎯 Turret rotation & firing that feels responsive

💥 Enemy AI that tracks and shoots back

💡 A damage and destruction system (blowing stuff up never gets old)

🔊 Sound & visual effects like explosions, smoke, and fire to make it come alive

🧱 HUD feedback for win/lose conditions

🧃 Extra polish with small VFX and audio touches to make the game feel better

Everything here is coded in C++ inside Unreal
